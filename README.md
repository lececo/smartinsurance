# Smart Insurance Proof of Concept on the COBI.Bike platform
This is the result of the BCW2020 hackathon. A custom module for the COBI.Bike platform currently available under the url: https://smartleeroy.herokuapp.com/.

We want to showcase a Pay-per-Use mobility insurance based on a realtime driving score, estimated by machine learning techniques that take sensors into account, which measure acceleration, speed, bearing and gps.
